  "question": "Determine the maximum chromosome count $k$ in gametes for an individual exhibiting three copies of a single autosome type while maintaining standard diploid pairing for all remaining chromosomes, given typical somatic cells comprise 23 chromosome pairs (22 autosome pairs and one sex chromosome pair) with 21 diploid autosome pairs contributing 21 chromosomes and sex chromosomes contributing one chromosome to gametes in maximum-count scenarios when the aberrant autosome type contributes two copies; using $k$ and given that experimental studies report 396 out of 1247 analyzed gametes contain two copies of the aberrant chromosome type under normal segregation of all non-aberrant chromosomes, compute the probability of producing a gamete with $k$ chromosomes rounded to three decimal places.",

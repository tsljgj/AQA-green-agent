  "question": "Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to create a new exam question based on the old one, but with strict rules to avoid hints and ensure it's standalone.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the old question and answer. The old problem was about a ball dropped from 20 meters with g=9.80665 m/s², zero initial velocity. The task was to find the distance traveled in the final second of descent, where the total fall time is rounded to two decimal places. The answer was 14.90 meters.\n\nNow, the new question extends this by asking for the change in kinetic energy per kilogram during that final second. The new answer is 146.12 J/kg. The key here is that the solver must first compute the 14.90 meters (the old answer) and then use it with g to find the energy change via ΔKE = g*d.\n\nLooking at the New Environment, I see CEVs (Constant Environment Variables) and DEVs (Derived Environment Variables). CEVs are the given conditions that must be explicitly stated in the new question. From the provided ENV_new:\n- cev_0: Use g = 9.80665 m/s² in free fall time calculation\n- cev_1: Assume initial velocity is zero for time to hit ground\n- cev_2: Round time calculation to two decimal places\n- cev_3: Use work-energy principle (work = mgd = ΔKE) for ΔKE per unit mass\n\nDEVs include things like the actual time (2.02 seconds), the distance (14.90 m), and the energy value (146.12 J/kg), which must not be mentioned directly.\n\nThe challenge is to craft a question that forces the solver to first compute the distance (14.90 m) as an intermediate step without revealing it. The new question must reference this intermediate result abstractly, like \"the distance traveled during the final second\" without stating its value.\n\nI need to embed the old problem compactly. The old question had specific details: 20m drop, zero initial velocity, g value, rounding time to two decimals. These must all be included as CEVs. Then, the new part applies the work-energy principle using that distance.\n\nThe anti-hint rules mean I can't say \"using the distance you found earlier\" or similar. Instead, I should refer to it as \"the distance traveled during the final second of descent\" and tie the energy calculation to that quantity.\n\nAlso, the question must have three distinct steps:\n1. Solve for the time and distance (old problem)\n2. Recognize that this distance is needed for energy calculation\n3. Apply ΔKE = g*d (since per unit mass, it's just g*d)\n\nLimiting phrases (LPs) should ensure uniqueness. For example, specifying that the energy change is per kilogram and using the work-energy principle as given.\n\nI need to check that without solving the first part, the energy part can't be answered. If someone tries to skip to energy, they don't have d. So the dependency is correct.\n\nNow, structuring the question in 1-4 sentences, ≤180 words, in LaTeX.\n\nStart by restating the old problem concisely. Then state the task using the intermediate distance. Include all CEVs: g value, zero initial velocity, rounding time, and the work-energy principle as a given.\n\nAvoid any mention of the old answer (14.90) or the new answer (146.12). Refer to the distance as \"the distance traveled during the final second\" without naming it.\n\nCheck for banned phrases. No \"prior\", \"previous\", etc.\n\nPossible draft:\n\n\"A ball is dropped from 20 meters with zero initial velocity under gravitational acceleration $ g = 9.80665  \\text{m/s}^2 $; compute the distance traveled during the final second of descent where the total fall duration used to determine the interval's start time (total time minus 1.00 second) is rounded to two decimal places. Using this distance and the work-energy principle stating that the change in kinetic energy per kilogram equals $ g $ times the distance traveled, determine the change in kinetic energy per kilogram during this final second.\"\n\nWait, but the old problem is embedded here. However, the instruction says to embed Q_old compactly. But the user says the new question must not reference prior parts. So actually, the entire old problem must be restated as part of the new question, since it's standalone.\n\nYes, because it's a standalone question. So the solver isn't expected to have seen the old question; the new question includes all necessary info, including the old problem's setup.\n\nSo the new question should start by describing the drop scenario (20m, zero initial velocity, g value, rounding time to two decimals) and ask for the distance in the final second—but wait, no. The new question isn't asking for the distance; it's using that distance to compute energy. But the solver must compute the distance as an intermediate step.\n\nAh, right. The new question should not explicitly ask for the distance; instead, it should ask for the energy, but the energy calculation depends on the distance, which the solver must compute first as part of the process.\n\nSo the question should describe the scenario (same as old question's setup) and then say: using the distance traveled during the final second of descent (which you must determine by calculating the total fall time rounded to two decimal places), apply the work-energy principle to find the change in kinetic energy per kilogram.\n\nBut how to phrase it without making it two separate questions.\n\nThe composition template suggests:\n\nSentence 1: Embed Q_old compactly and define an intermediate reference.\n\nSentence 2: State CEVs and new task.\n\nSo something like:\n\n\"Consider a ball dropped from 20 meters with zero initial velocity under $ g = 9.80665  \\text{m/s}^2 $, where the total fall duration rounded to two decimal places determines the start of the final second interval; compute the distance traveled during this final second. Using this distance and the work-energy principle stating that the change in kinetic energy per kilogram equals $ g $ times the distance, determine the change in kinetic energy per kilogram during the final second.\"\n\nBut that has two \"compute\" parts. The rule says the question must be one paragraph, 1-4 sentences. Also, R1 requires that the solver must implicitly solve Q_old first. So the question should only ask for the final answer (energy), but the path requires computing distance first.\n\nAh, important: the new question should only ask for the new answer (energy), not the old one (distance). The distance is an intermediate step the solver does internally.\n\nSo the question should be phrased as: [scenario], find the change in kinetic energy per kg during the final second, with the understanding that to do so, one must first find the distance.\n\nBut to make it solvable, the question must include all CEVs, including the work-energy principle as a given.\n\nSo revised:\n\n\"A ball is dropped from 20 meters with zero initial velocity under gravitational acceleration $ g = 9.80665  \\text{m/s}^2 $; the total fall duration used to define the final second interval (total time minus 1.00 second) is rounded to two decimal places. Using the work-energy principle which states that the change in kinetic energy per kilogram equals $ g $ times the distance traveled, determine this change in kinetic energy per kilogram during the final second of descent.\"\n\nBut does this force the solver to compute the distance? Yes, because they need the distance to plug into g*d. The distance isn't given; they have to calculate it from the drop scenario.\n\nNow, check CEVs:\n- cev_0: g=9.80665 is stated\n- cev_1: zero initial velocity is stated\n- cev_2: rounding time to two decimals is stated\n- cev_3: work-energy principle is stated as given\n\nDEVs like the actual time, distance, energy are not mentioned.\n\nAlso, no banned phrases. References to \"the distance traveled\" are abstract, not revealing its value.\n\nIs it unique? Yes, because the distance is uniquely determined by the setup, then energy is g*d.\n\nWord count: Let's see. The example I have is about 50 words. Under 180.\n\nBut let's make sure it's clear that the distance must be computed as per the old problem.\n\nWait, in the old problem, the distance during final second depends on the rounded total time. The new question must incorporate that the interval is defined using the rounded total time.\n\nIn the draft above: \"the total fall duration used to define the final second interval (total time minus 1.00 second) is rounded to two decimal places.\" That captures cev_2.\n\nAlso, the work-energy principle is given as cev_3.\n\nNow, check R5: three distinct steps.\n1. Compute total time (with rounding) to get start of final second.\n2. Compute distance in that final second.\n3. Multiply by g to get energy per kg.\n\nYes, three steps.\n\nLPs: The phrase \"rounded to two decimal places\" acts as an LP to ensure uniqueness. Without rounding, time might be exact, but rounding specifies how to handle it.\n\nAlso, specifying \"per kilogram\" and the principle ensures no mass is needed.\n\nFinal check: no mention of 14.90 or 146.12, no prior references.\n\nThis should work.\nA ball is dropped from 20 meters with zero initial velocity under gravitational acceleration $ g = 9.80665  \\text{m/s}^2 $, where the total fall duration rounded to two decimal places defines the start of the final second interval (total time minus 1.00 second); using the work-energy principle stating that the change in kinetic energy per kilogram equals $ g $ times the distance traveled during this interval, compute the change in kinetic energy per kilogram for the final second of descent.",

  "question": "Given an ecosystem where producers capture 10,000 kcal of energy and energy transfer between successive trophic levels adheres strictly to a 10% efficiency rule, compute the resulting energy available to tertiary consumers; then, using this quantity alongside the standard daily caloric intake reference value universally adopted in nutritional labeling frameworks, determine the duration in minutes this energy would sustain basic human metabolic functions at the reference rate, rounding your final answer to one decimal place.",

      "reasoning": "The solver's answer matches the expected answer exactly because applying the 10% transfer rule from 10,000 kcal through three trophic levels yields 10 kcal for tertiary consumers. Using the 2,000 kcal/day reference, 10 ÷ 2000 × 24 × 60 = 7.2 minutes is mathematically correct."

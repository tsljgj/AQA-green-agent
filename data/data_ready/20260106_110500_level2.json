  "question": "A gas expands isobarically from 2.0 liters at 300 K to a final state at 600 K under constant 1 atm pressure with all temperatures strictly in Kelvin; compute the energy quantity $E$ in joules using the conversion 101.325 J/(L·atm) for the expansion process calculation. Assuming monatomic ideal gas behavior, use $R = 0.0821$ L·atm/(mol·K) to derive the mole count exclusively from $E$ and $R = 8.314$ J/(mol·K) for thermal computations, then determine the total heat energy transferred during expansion where the molar heat capacity at constant pressure follows standard monatomic gas properties. Ensure the solution requires $E$ as the sole energy input for mole determination and yields a unique result consistent with the expansion constraints.",

      "reasoning": "The solver's 506.6 J and the expected 506.5 J are essentially identical, differing by only 0.1 J due to rounding. Both follow correct steps (final volume 4.0 L, work 202.65 J, n=0.0812 mol, Q ≈ 506.3–506.5 J), so the minor difference is a rounding artifact rather than a substantive disagreement."

  "question": "Determine the total power dissipation in watts for a parallel circuit comprising $6  \\Omega$, $12  \\Omega$, and $4  \\Omega$ resistors connected across a $12$-volt automotive battery, then utilize this determined value alongside the specifications that automotive lead-acid batteries exhibit $48  \\text{Ah}$ rated capacity enforcing a mandatory $50\\%$ depth-of-discharge restriction under standard conditions and manufacturer documentation stating the usable capacity at $0^\\circ\\text{F}$ is $50\\%$ of the capacity derived under the depth-of-discharge restriction to compute the practical operational runtime in hours under freezing temperatures.",

      "reasoning": "The solver's answer \"2 hours\" is mathematically equivalent to \"2.0 hours\", and the step-by-step calculations (equivalent resistance, power, current, usable battery capacity with 50% DoD and 50% temperature reduction) yield 12 Ah usable and 12 Ah / 6 A = 2 hours. Therefore the answers agree."

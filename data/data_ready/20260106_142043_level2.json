  "question": "Given an ecosystem where producers capture 10,000 kcal of energy with energy transfer between successive trophic levels strictly adhering to a 10% efficiency rule, compute the energy available to tertiary consumers; using this quantity alongside the metabolic rate derived from the standard daily caloric intake reference value universally adopted in nutritional labeling frameworks, determine the duration in minutes this energy would sustain moderate walking activity given a metabolic equivalent task (MET) value of 3.5—where MET quantifies energy expenditure relative to resting metabolism—and round your final answer to one decimal place.",

      "reasoning": "The solver's answer (2.1 minutes) matches the expected value because they correctly applied the 10% energy transfer across trophic levels and accurately computed metabolic rates (resting 1.389 kcal/min and walking 4.861 kcal/min) to divide the available 10 kcal by the expenditure rate. These calculations yield 2.057 minutes, which rounds to 2.1, so all steps are verified as correct."

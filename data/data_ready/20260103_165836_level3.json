  "question": "Consider the historically significant pharmaceutical product developed prior to May 8, 2020 by the entity holding current Botox trademark rights that exemplifies core therapeutic applications beyond cosmetic use and was subject to patent enforcement suspension during the early 2020 health crisis; reference the foundational scientific breakthrough associated with this product. This breakthrough received FDA approval in 1996 and directly initiated a therapy paradigm reducing related mortality by over 80% between 1996 and 1998 while establishing the modern standard of care. Using only historical medical documentation contemporaneous with its implementation, determine the formal name of this therapy paradigm.",

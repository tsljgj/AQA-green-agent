Independent verification of Harper Lee's 1961 Pulitzer, the 1957–58 Little Rock desegregation during Eisenhower, Daisy Bates' mentorship and co-founding of the Arkansas State Press in 1941, and the paper's October 29, 1959 closure due to an advertiser boycott confirm the factual chain leading to 1959."

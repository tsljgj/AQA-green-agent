  "question": "Determine the cultural practice anthropologically documented as serving ritual significance and ecological adaptation within territories naturally inhabited by the species recognized as the fastest land animal by major wildlife authorities, specifically maintained by indigenous communities in the African country containing its largest wild population; denote this quantity as $x$. Assuming the red ochre pigment used in $x$ is sourced within Namibia, identify the UNESCO-recognized archaeological site where identical ochre deposits have been utilized for rock art traditions spanning millennia, ensuring the site constitutes Namibia's first World Heritage inscription and exhibits material continuity through identical iron oxide composition in historical engravings and contemporary ritual applications.",

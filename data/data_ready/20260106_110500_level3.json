  "question": "An ideal gas expands isobarically from 2.0 liters at 300 K to 600 K under constant 1 atm pressure with temperatures strictly in Kelvin; compute the energy quantity $E$ in joules using 101.325 J/(L·atm) for work conversion, monatomic ideal gas behavior, $R = 0.0821$ L·atm/(mol·K) for mole determination, and $R = 8.314$ J/(mol·K) for thermal computations. Using this determined $E$ and the entropy change formula $\\Delta S = nC_p \\ln(T_2/T_1)$ for isobaric processes where all intermediate quantities derive exclusively from $E$ and given constants, calculate $\\Delta S$ in J/K ensuring consistency with the expansion constraints and Kelvin temperature requirements.",

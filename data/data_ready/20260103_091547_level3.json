  "question": "Determine the total valence electrons in 44 grams of CO₂ given its molar mass is 44 g/mol, each molecule contains exactly three atoms, and each molecule provides 16 valence electrons; using this quantity alongside the ionization energy of 13.776 eV per molecule and the conversion factor $1.60217662 \\times 10^{-19}$ J/eV, compute the total energy in joules required to ionize every molecule in the sample.",

      "reasoning": "The solver's answer \"Huygens probe\" exactly matches the expected answer and correctly cites that Saturn has 274 confirmed moons (as of March 2025), Titan is Saturn's largest moon, and Huygens first landed on Titan on January 14, 2005 while transmitting surface images. Therefore both answers are identical with no ambiguity or evidence against the expected answer."

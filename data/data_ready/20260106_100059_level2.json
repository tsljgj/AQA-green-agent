  "question": "Determine the total power dissipation in watts for a parallel circuit comprising $6  \\Omega$, $12  \\Omega$, and $4  \\Omega$ resistors connected across a $12$-volt automotive battery, then utilize this determined value alongside the given specifications that standard automotive lead-acid batteries exhibit $48  \\text{Ah}$ capacity and enforce a mandatory $50\\%$ depth-of-discharge restriction to compute the practical operational runtime in hours.",

    "Use 12 volts as the battery voltage when calculating total power dissipation",

    "The equivalent resistance calculated using the parallel resistance formula is 2.0 ohms",
    "The equivalent resistance of the circuit is 2 ohms",
    "The total power dissipation is 72.0 watts",
    "The total power dissipated in the circuit when connected to a 12-volt automotive battery is 72 W",
    "The usable battery capacity considering the 50% depth-of-discharge restriction is 24 Ah",
    "The theoretical runtime with full 48 Ah battery capacity would be 8 hours",
    "The practical runtime of the circuit using a standard automotive battery with 50% depth-of-discharge restriction is 4.0 hours"

      "reasoning": "The solver's answer \"4 hours\" is mathematically identical to the expected answer \"4.0 hours\" — they differ only in decimal notation. The solver's step-by-step calculations are all correct, properly applying parallel resistance formulas, Ohm's law, power equations, and the specified battery constraints, so there is no ambiguity."

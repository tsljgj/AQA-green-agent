  "question": "Calculate the percentage of offspring exhibiting both recessive phenotypes in a dihybrid cross between heterozygous parents (AaBb × AaBb) under independent assortment of the two traits, denoting this quantity as $ q $; using $ q $, determine the percentage of offspring showing all three recessive phenotypes in a trihybrid cross (AaBbCc × AaBbCc) with independent assortment across all traits, ensuring the solution follows strictly from multiplicative probability under Mendelian inheritance without linkage or epistasis.",

      "reasoning": "Both answers agree because the solver correctly applied the van't Hoff equation and obtained 102.4858°C (reported as 102.49°C) using K₁ = 5.48×10⁻¹⁴. The expected 102.4°C is the same value rounded to one decimal place, so the 0.09°C difference is within acceptable rounding tolerance."

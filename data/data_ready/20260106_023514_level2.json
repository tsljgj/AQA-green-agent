  "question": "Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to create a new, standalone exam question that's very difficult by extending an existing problem. The key constraints are strict \"anti-hint\" rules, meaning I can't reference previous parts or give away answers indirectly.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the inputs. The old question was about finding the most significant geopolitical conflict in the year when the world's most spoken native language (Mandarin Chinese) was established as a national language. The answer was the Suez Crisis. The new ground truth is the United Nations Emergency Force (UNEF).\n\nLooking at the New Environment, there are constants (CEVs) and derived variables (DEVs). The only CEV is that English ranks highest in total speakers but not native speakers. All other details like Mandarin being the most spoken native language, the 1956 establishment, and UNEF being the peacekeeping force are DEVs that I must not reveal in the question.\n\nThe challenge is to craft a question where the solver must first determine the year (1956) by figuring out when Mandarin became China's national language, then identify the Suez Crisis as the conflict that year, and finally realize UNEF was the first UN peacekeeping force created to resolve it. But I can't mention any of these directly.\n\nI need to embed the old problem without referencing it. So the first part should ask for the geopolitical conflict in the year when the most spoken native language (with the note about English) was established as a national language. But since I can't state that the answer is Suez Crisis, I have to phrase it so that the solver has to find that conflict first.\n\nThen, the new part must require using that conflict to find the first UN peacekeeping force established as its direct resolution. But I can't say \"Suez Crisis\" or \"1956\". Instead, I have to refer to \"the identified conflict\" or similar neutral terms.\n\nFor CEVs, I must include the note about English not being the top native language. For DEVs like Mandarin or UNEF, I can't mention them. The tricky part is adding constraints (LPs) that ensure uniqueness without leaking info. For example, specifying that the peacekeeping force must be the first established through a General Assembly resolution as a direct diplomatic resolution.\n\nI should check if the constraints are tight enough: Without knowing it's the Suez Crisis, would someone know which conflict's resolution involved the first UN peacekeeping force? But the LPs should only make sense after identifying the conflict. So phrases like \"the most significant international geopolitical conflict of that year\" and \"first United Nations peacekeeping force established as a direct diplomatic resolution\" should only point to UNEF once the conflict is known.\n\nWord count is a concern. Need to keep it under 180 words, one paragraph, 1-4 sentences. Let me draft:\n\n\"Determine the first United Nations peacekeeping force established as a direct diplomatic resolution to the most significant international geopolitical conflict occurring during the year when the world's most spoken native language—considering English ranks highest in total speakers but not native speakers—was formally established as a national language; specify the force's official designation, ensuring it was created through a General Assembly resolution as the inaugural armed UN operation for conflict resolution.\"\n\nWait, that's one sentence but might be too nested. Let me check the CEVs: included the English note. DEVs like Mandarin, 1956, Suez Crisis aren't mentioned. Refers to \"the most significant conflict\" which the solver must find first. The LPs: \"created through a General Assembly resolution\" and \"inaugural armed UN operation\" ensure it's UNEF without naming it.\n\nIs it solvable? Solver must: 1) Find the language (Mandarin), year (1956). 2) Identify conflict (Suez Crisis). 3) Recall UNEF was the first peacekeeping force for it via GA resolution. The constraints prevent confusion with other forces like ONUC.\n\nCheck word count: ~50 words. Under limit. No banned phrases. Uses \"the most significant conflict\" as neutral reference. Should work.\nDetermine the official designation of the first United Nations peacekeeping force established as a direct diplomatic resolution to the most significant international geopolitical conflict occurring during the year when the world's most spoken native language—considering English ranks highest in total speakers but not native speakers—was formally established as a national language, ensuring the force was created through a General Assembly resolution as the inaugural armed UN operation deployed specifically to resolve that conflict.",

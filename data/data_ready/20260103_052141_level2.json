  "question": "Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to generate a new exam question based on the provided inputs, following strict rules. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the old question and its answer. The old question was about finding the first woman to win a Nobel Prize (Marie Curie) and then identifying her child who also won a Nobel before 1941 (Irène Joliot-Curie). The new question needs to extend this by having the solver use Irène's work to find the first medically used artificial radioisotope before 1941, which is phosphorus-32.\n\nLooking at the New Environment, I see that the constants are empty, so all the derived variables (dev_0 to dev_11) are DEVs. That means none of these can be mentioned explicitly in the new question. The CEVs must be the environmental constraints that are given, like the year 1941, the requirement for medical treatment, etc.\n\nThe key here is to embed the old subproblem without referencing it directly. The new question must require solving the old problem first (getting Irène Joliot-Curie as the answer) and then using that to find phosphorus-32. But I can't mention Irène by name or state what the intermediate result is. Instead, I need to refer to it abstractly as \"the determined individual\" or similar.\n\nI need to check the required structure: 1-4 sentences, self-contained, no references to prior solutions. The first sentence should embed the old problem. Let me rephrase the old question concisely: \"Determine the earliest individual who is both the child of the first woman Nobel laureate and a laureate themselves with awards before 1941.\" But wait, the original old question was to determine the first woman, then her child. So the intermediate result is Irène. The new question needs to use that result.\n\nWait, the old ground truth is Irène Joliot-Curie. So the new question must have the solver find that individual first (without naming her), then use her discovery to find the radioisotope.\n\nThe expansion steps mention that Irène's 1934 discovery led to medical use of phosphorus-32 in 1936. The CEVs here would be the constraints: medical treatment, prior to 1941, first artificially created vital element. But I can't state that phosphorus-32 is the answer; the solver must derive it.\n\nSo the new question should say something like: Solve the old problem to get the individual, then find the first radioisotope from their work used medically before 1941.\n\nBut how to phrase it without leaking? The CEVs are the constraints: must be a vital element, used in medical treatment, prior to 1941, and stemming from the determined individual's methodology.\n\nI need to define the intermediate reference. Since it's history, per section 2.5, use a noun phrase like \"the identified laureate\" or \"the determined individual.\"\n\nLet me draft:\n\n\"Determine the earliest individual who is both the child of the first woman Nobel Prize winner and a laureate with awards granted before 1941. Using the methodology developed by this determined individual, identify the first artificially created vital element administered in medical treatment prior to 1941, ensuring the isotope was produced via particle bombardment and applied for leukemia therapy.\"\n\nWait, but \"leukemia therapy\" might be too specific. The LPs need to be conditional filters. The solver must know it's from the individual's work, so \"stemming from the methodology of this individual\" is a CEV? Or is that a DEV?\n\nLooking at the DEVs, dev_10 says the phosphorus-32 was produced using cyclotron from Joliot-Curies' methodology. So \"produced via particle bombardment\" is part of the methodology, which is a DEV. But the question must include CEVs. Wait, the CEVs are the given conditions. The ENV_new has constants as empty, so all CEVs must be inferred from the expansion steps.\n\nWait, the New Environment constants are empty, so the only CEVs are the constraints mentioned in the expansion steps that are necessary for the problem. For example, \"prior to 1941\" is a CEV from the old question. The new CEVs would be \"medical treatment\", \"vital element\", \"artificially created\".\n\nBut the problem is to include all CEVs. The expansion steps mention \"first medical application of artificial radioisotopes prior to 1941\", so the CEVs are: must be an artificially created vital element, used in medical treatment, prior to 1941.\n\nAlso, the methodology part: \"stemming from the determined individual's discovery\" is a CEV? Because the expansion steps say it's directly stemming from their work. So the question must state that the isotope must be a result of the individual's methodology.\n\nBut how to phrase it without leaking. The question should say: \"the isotope must have been created through the methodology developed by this individual and used in the first medical application prior to 1941 for treating leukemia.\"\n\nWait, but specifying \"leukemia\" might be a LP that's too specific. Let's check the expansion steps: dev_9 says it was used to treat chronic leukemia. But if the question says \"for leukemia therapy\", that might help uniqueness, but is it leaking?\n\nThe anti-hint rule says LPs should not be guessable without knowing A_old. If someone searches \"first medical use of radioisotope before 1941\", they might find phosphorus-32 for leukemia. But if the question requires it to be connected to the determined individual (Irène), then without knowing who she is, they can't link it. So the LP \"stemming from the methodology of the determined individual\" is crucial.\n\nSo the question needs to tie the isotope to the individual's work. So the CEVs are:\n\n- Isotope must be artificially created\n- Vital element\n- Used in medical treatment\n- Prior to 1941\n- Stemming from the methodology of the determined individual (from the first part)\n\nBut \"vital element\" is from dev_8, which is a DEV. Wait, dev_8 says \"phosphorus-32 was identified as the first artificially created 'vital element'\". So \"vital element\" is part of the DEV. Therefore, in the question, I shouldn't say \"vital element\"; instead, perhaps \"essential biological element\" or just state it's used in medical treatment for a specific condition.\n\nWait, the New Ground Truth is phosphorus-32, and the key is that it's the first used medically before 1941 from that methodology.\n\nThe expansion steps mention \"first medical application of artificial radioisotopes prior to 1941\" and \"phosphorus-32 was administered... to treat chronic leukemia\".\n\nSo the CEVs for the new part are:\n\n- Must be an artificially created radioisotope\n- Used in medical treatment\n- Prior to 1941\n- Resulting from the particle bombardment methodology of the determined individual\n\nBut \"particle bombardment\" is part of the methodology, which is a DEV. However, the question must include CEVs. Wait, the CEVs are the given constraints. Since the ENV_new constants are empty, the CEVs must be derived from the problem context. The user says: \"CEVs: Facts/assumptions/given conditions that must appear explicitly in the final question.\"\n\nIn the expansion steps, the key given conditions are:\n\n- Medical treatment\n- Prior to 1941\n- First application\n- Stemming from the individual's methodology\n\nSo the question should state: \"identify the first radioisotope created through this individual's methodology that was used in medical treatment before 1941.\"\n\nBut to ensure uniqueness, maybe add that it was used for leukemia, but that might be too specific. Wait, the old problem used \"prior to 1941\" as a constraint to make it unique. Similarly, here, the constraints should be that it's the first such isotope used medically before 1941, stemming from the methodology.\n\nThe LPs need to be such that without knowing the individual is Irène, you can't find the isotope. But once you know it's her, you know her work led to phosphorus-32.\n\nSo the question structure:\n\n1. Solve the old problem to get the individual (rephrased without naming).\n2. Using that individual's methodology, find the first radioisotope used medically before 1941.\n\nNow, phrasing without leaks.\n\n\"Determine the earliest person who is both the child of the first female Nobel laureate and a laureate with awards prior to 1941. Using the radioisotope production method established by this determined individual, identify the first artificially generated isotope administered in medical treatment before 1941, where the application specifically addressed hematological malignancy.\"\n\nWait, \"hematological malignancy\" is a bit too technical and might hint at leukemia, but it's a general term. However, the risk is that without knowing the individual, someone might search and find it's phosphorus-32 for leukemia. But the key is that the isotope must be tied to the individual's method. Since Irène's method is particle bombardment for artificial radioisotopes, the question should specify \"artificially generated via particle bombardment\".\n\nBut \"particle bombardment\" is part of the methodology, which is a DEV. However, the question must include CEVs. Wait, the methodology is a DEV, so I can't state it's particle bombardment. Instead, refer to \"the methodology developed by this individual\" as a CEV.\n\nSo: \"Using the methodology developed by this determined individual for creating artificial radioisotopes, identify the first such isotope used in medical treatment prior to 1941.\"\n\nBut \"artificial radioisotopes\" might be okay as it's a general term. However, the old problem's answer is Irène, who discovered artificial radioactivity, so \"artificial radioisotopes\" is part of her work.\n\nWait, the term \"artificial radioisotopes\" is from the expansion steps (dev_7: \"artificial radioactivity directly enabled the production of medical radioisotopes\"). So using \"artificial radioisotopes\" in the question is acceptable as a CEV because it's part of the problem's given context.\n\nBut the anti-hint rule says not to reveal DEVs. Is \"artificial radioisotopes\" a DEV? The DEVs include dev_7 which states that her discovery enabled production, so the term itself might be part of the DEV. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, phrase it as \"isotopes produced through novel activation techniques\" but that's vague. Maybe better to use \"artificially created isotopes\" as it's a standard term.\n\nThe key is to include the necessary constraints without giving away the answer. Let's check the word count and structure.\n\nFinal draft attempt:\n\n\"Determine the earliest individual who is both the child of the first woman Nobel Prize winner and a laureate with awards granted before 1941. Using the radioisotope synthesis approach pioneered by this determined person, identify the first medically administered artificially produced isotope prior to 1941, ensuring the treatment targeted blood cancer and utilized an element essential to metabolic processes.\"\n\nWait, \"blood cancer\" is leukemia, which might be too specific. The expansion steps mention chronic leukemia. But the LP should be a conditional filter. If someone doesn't know the individual, \"blood cancer\" might lead them to phosphorus-32, but only if they know it's connected. However, the main constraint is the connection to the individual's method.\n\nAlternatively, remove the disease specificity and just say \"medical treatment\", but then there might be other isotopes. The uniqueness comes from it being the first, so \"first medically administered...\"\n\nLet me check the expansion steps: dev_9 says it was the first medical application. So the CEV is \"first medical application\".\n\nSo: \"identify the first isotope created via this individual's methodology that was used in medical treatment before 1941.\"\n\nBut to ensure it's unique, maybe add \"for a life-threatening condition\" or something, but that might not help.\n\nWait, the original old question used \"prior to 1941\" to ensure uniqueness. Similarly, here, \"first... prior to 1941\" should suffice.\n\nAnother angle: the isotope must be a \"vital element\", but since that's a DEV (dev_8), I can't use that term. Instead, say \"an element critical to biological function\".\n\nBut \"critical to biological function\" might be okay as a CEV.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\n\"Determine the earliest person who is both the child of the first female Nobel laureate and a laureate with awards prior to 1941. Using the artificial radioisotope production technique developed by this identified individual, find the first such isotope administered medically before 1941 that is an essential biological element.\"\n\nNow, check if this leaks. \"Essential biological element\" might hint at phosphorus (since P is in DNA, etc.), but without knowing the individual is Irène, it's hard to connect. The key is that the solver must first get Irène, then know her work led to P-32 for leukemia treatment.\n\nBut the question doesn't mention leukemia, so maybe it's not unique? Wait, according to the expansion steps, it's the first medical application, so \"first\" should make it unique.\n\nWait, are there other artificial radioisotopes used medically before 1941? From history, phosphorus-32 was the first. So \"first\" is sufficient.\n\nSo the question:\n\n\"Determine the earliest individual who is both the child of the first woman Nobel Prize winner and a laureate with awards granted before 1941. Using the methodology established by this determined person for creating artificial radioisotopes, identify the first isotope of an essential biological element administered in medical treatment prior to 1941.\"\n\nWord count: around 50 words. Let's check requirements.\n\n- Embedded old problem: yes, rephrased.\n- Intermediate reference: \"this determined person\"\n- CEVs: \"artificial radioisotopes\", \"essential biological element\", \"medical treatment prior to 1941\", \"first\"\n- DEVs not leaked: doesn't mention particle bombardment, leukemia, etc.\n- Unique solvability: the first such isotope is phosphorus-32.\n\nBut is \"essential biological element\" a DEV? Dev_8 says phosphorus-32 is the first \"vital element\". So \"essential biological element\" is a paraphrase of \"vital element\", which is part of the DEV. Therefore, including that phrase might be leaking a DEV.\n\nAh, problem. The term \"vital element\" is from dev_8, which is a DEV. So I shouldn't use \"essential biological element\" as it's synonymous.\n\nInstead, drop that part and rely on \"first medically administered artificial radioisotope prior to 1941\".\n\nBut would that be unique? Without the \"essential\" part, maybe other isotopes could be considered, but historically, P-32 was the first. So perhaps just:\n\n\"Determine the earliest individual who is both the child of the first woman Nobel Prize winner and a laureate with awards granted before 1941. Using the artificial radioisotope creation method pioneered by this identified person, find the first isotope administered in medical treatment prior to 1941.\"\n\nNow, check uniqueness. Is there any other artificial radioisotope used medically before 1941? From research, no—P-32 was the first. So \"first\" ensures uniqueness.\n\nBut the question must have exactly one answer, which is phosphorus-32.\n\nAlso, the intermediate step is mandatory: solver must find Irène first, then know her method produced P-32 for medical use.\n\nNow, check anti-hint rules: no mention of A_old (Irène), no description of her (like \"female\" or \"chemist\"), just \"this identified person\".\n\nThe phrase \"artificial radioisotope creation method\" is okay because it's a general term derived from the context (the individual's work on artificial radioactivity).\n\nFinal check:\n\n- Standalone: yes, no references to prior questions.\n- CEVs included: prior to 1941, medical treatment, first, artificial radioisotope method.\n- DEVs not leaked: doesn't specify particle bombardment, leukemia, etc.\n- Three steps: solve old problem, link to method, find isotope.\n- Word count: approx 40 words, one paragraph, two sentences.\n\nThis should meet all requirements.\nDetermine the earliest individual who is both the child of the first woman Nobel Prize winner and a laureate with awards granted before 1941. Using the artificial radioisotope synthesis methodology established by this determined person, identify the first isotope administered in medical treatment prior to 1941.",
